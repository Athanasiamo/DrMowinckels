This package is developed with co-worker Didac Vidal Pineiro, whose had the whole idea.

This package is meant to use for visualizing brain segmentations, often referred to as brain atlases.
There is currenlty no shiny demonstration of it, but we will make that at some point. 

It is, however, ready to install using devtools in R, directly from github.
