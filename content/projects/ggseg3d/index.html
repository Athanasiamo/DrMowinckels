<p>This package is based on my initial idea, and developed with co-worker Didac Vidal Pi√±eiro.</p>
<p>This package is meant to use for visualizing brain segmentations, often referred to as brain atlases.
Click the eye below to see a demonstration of the package.</p>
<p>It is also ready to install using devtools in R, directly from github.</p>
