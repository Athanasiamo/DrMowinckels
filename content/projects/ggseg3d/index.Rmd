This package is based on my initial idea, and developed with co-worker Didac Vidal Pi√±eiro.

This package is meant to use for visualizing brain segmentations, often referred to as brain atlases.
Click the eye below to see a demonstration of the package.

It is also ready to install using devtools in R, directly from github.
