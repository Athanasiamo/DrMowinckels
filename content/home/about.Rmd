### Athanasia Monika Mowinckel

I am a cognitive neuroscientist based in Oslo, Norway, who works at the [Center for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition](www.oslobrains.no). I am passionate about cognitive neuroscience, teaching people the benefits of using R, and improving gender diversity and equity in the R-community (and in data science) through [RLadies-Oslo](www.twitter.com/RLadies_Oslo).
