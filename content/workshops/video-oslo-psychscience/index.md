We started Oslo Psychscience as a science communication challenge for young researchers at the Department of Psychology, at the University of Oslo. 
Guro LÃ¸seth Engvik and I arranged Pecha Kucha nights with young researchers presenting their projects. 
I have presented here twice, and been the host of one.
