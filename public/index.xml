      <description>There is currently a lack of tools for vislualising results from MRI analyses in R, most packages call an external command to open a viewer in another program. There is, however, advantages to visualise directly from R, among other increased understanding of the underlying data.
In this project, tentatively called visMRI, the idea is to create a shiny instance that will function as a viewer for MRI results. Ultimately, I hope to launch something that might be used on a .</description>

A co-worker was working on some generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) through the R package mgcv. The analyses work very well, and results were as expected. There were also some built in plotting functions for the gamm output in R.</description>
