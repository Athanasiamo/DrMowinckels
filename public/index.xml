      <description>This package is developed with co-worker Didac Vidal Pineiro, whose had the whole idea.
This package is meant to use for visualizing brain segmentations, often referred to as brain atlases. Click the eye below to see a demonstration of the package.
It is also ready to install using devtools in R, directly from github.

      <description>There is currently a lack of tools for visualising results from MRI analyses in R, most packages call an external command to open a viewer in another program. There is, however, advantages to visualise directly from R, among other increased understanding of the underlying data.
In this project, tentatively called visMRI, the idea is to create a shiny instance that will function as a viewer for MRI results. Ultimately, I hope to launch something that might be used on a .</description>

      <description>In short I am a cognitive neuroscientist based in Oslo, Norway, and works at the Center for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition. I‚Äôm passionate about cognitive neuroscience, using R and teaching the world the wonders of R. Doing all I can to improve gender diversity in the R-community though RLadies-Oslo.

      <title>Using Freesurfer annotation files to plot in R</title>

      <description>When you work with neuroimaging data like I do, you often find your self swapping back and forth between R and the imaging software of your choise. For me, that is usually FSL or Freesurfer. Since the resolution of the brain we have is quite large and 3 dimensional, we often reduce the data to segments that meaningfully go together. For instance, areas of the brain that control language or visual processing, or areas of the brain with similar structural properties.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs time for another Christmas special. Last year I made a Christmas tree ggplot, and animated some snow and sparkling baubles. That was a lot of fun, and I decided I wanted to do something similar this year too. But this year we‚Äôre going to build a snowman.
Body A snowman needs a body, so lets start with that! Let‚Äôs go for a two large body ball‚Äôs, and a head.</description>

      <description>Looking through my blogposts, I realised I‚Äôve never written about my colleague Didac and my package for 3d mesh plots of brain atlases using plotly. I‚Äôve already showed some functionality from out {ggseg}-package, in the introductory blogpost and follow-up on animating it.
I guess it‚Äôs extra timely to do it now, as we recently split the mesh-plot function off the main {ggseg}-package and into it‚Äôs own package, and also did some re-writing of core-functionality of the package.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm full of making packages and unit testing these days, and I don‚Äôt feel particularly confident in my unit testing skills to be sharing those yet. But, thankfully, I am also back in the GAMM corner lately. There is something very satisfying to me about running appropriate models and seeing the results. But, plotting the results of GAMMs are not always so easy, especially if you have some interactions in there.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs been a very long time since I wrote anything. Life has been unexpectedly overwhelming for a period, still is I guess, but one musters on. I‚Äôm sitting in old town Fredrikstad while my cat is getting some tests at the vets‚Äô, so I finally get some time and want to write something here. And we will continue with some R for Psychologists.

      <description>I‚Äôve already posted about what I liked so much about RStudio::conf 2019, and while I could continue chanting that over and over without it ever being able to properly convey how lovely it was, I am going to continue into another report from the conference.
There were several pre-conference workshops to attend, which I of course signed up for. After debating heavily with my self of what to choose, the cruelty was really that all the workshops looked amazing, I decided to go for ‚ÄúBuilding tidy tools‚Äù with Charlotte Wickham and Hadley Wickham.</description>

      <description>There is something to be said about the R-community. Actually, there is a lot to be said about the R-community, and I believe RStudio::conf is the empitamy of what this community actually is. While I‚Äôm in my hotel room as RStudio::conf Austin has just wrapped up, ending with an amazing Birds of a Feather session with RLadies, I‚Äôm having so many thoughts and feelings about this experience. I‚Äôm on a complete high, and cannot fathom that I just participated in something like this conference, which is quite something different than any other conference I have been to.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs Christmas! And I love Christmas! Pretty snow, cozy fires, fairy lights, family, friends and love. It‚Äôs just filled with all times of lovely things.
That also means‚Ä¶ PLOTS! You might know from my previous posts that I love plotting. A bit too much, but it truly is a lovely thing to create a great plot.
So, a while ago, the amazing RLadies network showed me this cool thing a stats professor does each Christmas at the end of his visualisation lecture, I knew I had to do it!</description>

      <title>R for psychologists - just dive into it!</title>

      <description>I recently was talking with a good friend and brilliant researcher regarding the advantages of R. As you can guess, I was the advocate. Coming from psychology, we are mainly taught to use ‚Äúsimple‚Äù analysis tools, and mainly SPSS. I never liked SPSS, even as a student. not knowing of any possible alternatives or what could be improved, I just thought the whole thing felt too black-boxy. But it is a convenient tool, when the data is already in a relatively clean format, and the analyses you want to do are straight forward, and you don‚Äôt mind not knowing exactly the formula SPSS uses to calculate your results.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm super delighted that our ggseg package was so well received! We almost immediately got it on Neuroconductor, which is a neuroimaging equivalent to Bioconductor. We got some pull requests from people helping us improve the code, and particularly get it ready for CRAN when we decide to submit it there.
In all of this, I learned so much about creating packages, and ended up making quite a major alteration to the base-functions of the package.</description>

      <guid>/blog/introducing-the-ggseg-r-package-for-brain-segmentations/</guid>
      <description>Edit: Though posted only a week ago, we have discovered another R package called ggBrain which has slightly different functions than what our package has. Because of this, we have altered the name of our package to ggseg short for ggsegmentation which is a better description of what our package does.
I‚Äôve not written a post in a while. Mostly because of summer vacation, and also because I have been a little swamped at work.</description>

      <description>Last post was definately my most succesful (and I have so much experience :P). But it was fun with all the feedback and appreciation. So I‚Äôll continue with a little more plotting. Circular plots are becoming more and more popular in for visualising associatetions between different phenomena. I think they look pretty cool, and while I have not yet published a paper with it, I did prep a lot of scripts for plotting my analysis results with it, with BRAINS!</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm working a lot with Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) lately, and so, it seems I will be doing a small series on them as we go now. After a little feedback, I did some small alterations to the last post, hopefully it is a little easier to follow, you can read it here.
For this part I‚Äôd like to talk about random effects in mgcv::gamm as they are a little different from what I am used to from, for instance lme4 or even a standard GAM.</description>

      <description>Here we go! Stepping into the world of blogging through R and blogdown! This is both super exciting and slightly scary, I have not really shared code online like I plan here before. But I guess we start somewhere. And we start with plotting.
A co-worker was working on some generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) through the R package mgcv. The analyses work very well, and results were as expected.</description>
