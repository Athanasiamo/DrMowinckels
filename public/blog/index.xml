      <title>Introducing the ggseg R-package for brain segmentations</title>

      <description>Edit: Though posted only a week ago, we have discovered another R package called ggBrain which has slightly different functions than what our package has. Because of this, we have altered the name of our package to ggseg short for ggsegmentation which is a better description of what our package does.
I’ve not written a post in a while. Mostly because of summer vacation, and also because I have been a little swamped at work.</description>

      <title>Circular plots in R and adding images</title>

      <description>Last post was definately my most succesful (and I have so much experience :P). But it was fun with all the feedback and appreciation. So I’ll continue with a little more plotting. Circular plots are becoming more and more popular in for visualising associatetions between different phenomena. I think they look pretty cool, and while I have not yet published a paper with it, I did prep a lot of scripts for plotting my analysis results with it, with BRAINS!</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago we had out first RLadies-Oslo meetup! It was such a great turnout, and I had so much fun presenting to the group of lovely folks!
First @RLadies_Oslo meetup with @DrMowinckels: &amp;quot;I love plotting&amp;quot; ♥️ #rstats #Rladies pic.twitter.com/UTS5QCy3HE
&amp;mdash; Lene Drøsdal (@ldrosdal) April 23, 2018  And indeed it is true, I love plotting. Probably more than I love analysing data (and definately more than cleaning and wrangling :P).</description>

      <title>GAMM random effects</title>

      <description>I’m working a lot with Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) lately, and so, it seems I will be doing a small series on them as we go now. After a little feedback, I did some small alterations to the last post, hopefully it is a little easier to follow, you can read it here.
For this part I’d like to talk about random effects in mgcv::gamm as they are a little different from what I am used to from, for instance lme4 or even a standard GAM.</description>

      <description>Here we go! Stepping into the world of blogging through R and blogdown! This is both super exciting and slightly scary, I have not really shared code online like I plan here before. But I guess we start somewhere. And we start with plotting.
A co-worker was working on some generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) through the R package mgcv. The analyses work very well, and results were as expected. There were also some built in plotting functions for the gamm output in R.</description>
