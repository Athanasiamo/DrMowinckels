      <description>It’s time for another Christmas special. Last year I made a Christmas tree ggplot, and animated some snow and sparkling baubles. That was a lot of fun, and I decided I wanted to do something similar this year too. But this year we’re going to build a snowman.
Body A snowman needs a body, so lets start with that! Let’s go for a two large body ball’s, and a head.</description>

      <title>ggseg3d - creating interactive brain segmentation plots with plotly</title>

      <description>Looking through my blogposts, I realised I’ve never written about my colleague Didac and my package for 3d mesh plots of brain atlases using plotly. I’ve already showed some functionality from out {ggseg}-package, in the introductory blogpost and follow-up on animating it.
I guess it’s extra timely to do it now, as we recently split the mesh-plot function off the main {ggseg}-package and into it’s own package, and also did some re-writing of core-functionality of the package.</description>

      <title>Introducing the ggseg R-package for brain segmentations</title>

      <description>Edit: Though posted only a week ago, we have discovered another R package called ggBrain which has slightly different functions than what our package has. Because of this, we have altered the name of our package to ggseg short for ggsegmentation which is a better description of what our package does.
I’ve not written a post in a while. Mostly because of summer vacation, and also because I have been a little swamped at work.</description>

      <title>Circular plots in R and adding images</title>

      <description>Last post was definately my most succesful (and I have so much experience :P). But it was fun with all the feedback and appreciation. So I’ll continue with a little more plotting. Circular plots are becoming more and more popular in for visualising associatetions between different phenomena. I think they look pretty cool, and while I have not yet published a paper with it, I did prep a lot of scripts for plotting my analysis results with it, with BRAINS!</description>
