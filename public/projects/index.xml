      <description>This package uses the nettskjema API developed by the University of Oslo IT, making it possible to communicate with the University of Oslo specialized survey platform &amp;lsquo;nettskjema&amp;rsquo;. Currently the package is geared towards downloading and creating data.frames in R from answers to surveys. This is an easy and convenient way for people to access data they have stored in the survey platform into R and ready for analyses.
