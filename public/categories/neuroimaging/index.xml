      <description>I’ve not written a post in a while. Mostly because of summer vacation, and also because I have been a little swamped at work. Fortunately, I got back to work with new gusto in August, and have something exciting to show you!
A while a go, my co-worker Didac, approached me with an idea for creating the possibility to plot brain segmentations directly in R. I loved the idea, and went straight at it, though, overly complicated and the initial project I started is a little stalled.</description>

      <description>Last post was definately my most succesful (and I have so much experience :P). But it was fun with all the feedback and appreciation. So I’ll continue with a little more plotting. Circular plots are becoming more and more popular in for visualising associatetions between different phenomena. I think they look pretty cool, and while I have not yet published a paper with it, I did prep a lot of scripts for plotting my analysis results with it, with BRAINS!</description>
